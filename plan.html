                <li>Encourage performers to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc...</li>
            </ul>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success evalutaion of recruitment will be evaluated by the increase of new members over the past three months. It will be considered as successful should the new members quota reach the goal of 30 members.<br>
Engagement of current members will be evaluated through the increase of signs ups for voluntary activities such as organising and promoting concerts and workshops, as well as volunteering for administration.<br>
Success of increased ticket sales will be gauged by increase of ticket sales to the public. Meeting the quota of 50 ticket sales per concert to the general public would be considered as a success<br>
Increase of concerts requested and held would be the evalutaion of the success of getting performers to allow us to hold concerts for them.</p>
