		<p style="font-weight: bold;">Volunteer Singers / Musicians </p>

		<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. <br>
		I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. <br>
		Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music.<br>
		I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. <br>
		<p>Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;">If you would like to take part, please call Merle Trembath <a href="tel:0418882633">0418882633</a> anytime </p>
