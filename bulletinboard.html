				<h2>Volunteer Singers / Musicians </h2>

				<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. Invited members will bring a plate for a buffet and music is provided by friends who can sing or perform.</p>
				<p>Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. All kinds of song genre or performance are welcomed so long as it is not too controversial. An artist to sing a medley of old time favorites would be preferable.</p>
				<p>Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 7pm.</p>

				<p><em>If you are interested, please call Merle Trembath <a href="tel:0418882633">0418882633</a></em></p>

				<h2>Metropolitan Opera 2015</h2>
