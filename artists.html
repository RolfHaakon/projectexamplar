				<h2>Aquapella</h2>
				<p>Aquapella consist of 50 singers from the Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best: inspiring and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" in French - a sumptuous variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to entertain and move you in the wonderful common language of music. Come along and travel the world by song!</p>
				<div id="more1" style="display:none;">
				<p>Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years. 
                <br><br>
                In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved himself in choir music again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in major festivals like the National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC documentary Ã¬Festival on Fire and launched their first CD 'Mosaic'. Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful world music choir for the Townsville area. 
                <br><br>
                Beat's choirs focus on the rich musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a cappella world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very enriching and uplifting experience.
                <br><br>
                Aquapella won the ABC Choir of the Year competition for Queensland in 2006.

				<h2>The Camerata Singers</h2>
				<p>The Camerata Singers is comprised of a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions. <br>
				</p>
				<div id="more3" style="display:none;">
					<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall’Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotter’s Markets in the mall.</p>

				<h2>Stokes Nicholson Big Band</h2>
				<p>The Stokes-Nicholson Big Band is a non-profit community 22 piece Big Band playing Jazz and Big Band music. 
				</p>
			
				<div id="more7" style="display:none;">
					<p>The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and Les Nicholson. Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band, perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to absorb the musical synergy that classroom teaching alone cannot develop. 
					<br><br>
					A number of experienced musicians were invited to join the various sections of the new Big Band with most sections being led by a member of Les' already well-established Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band. The original Principals were Roy Stokes (not a member of PMJB), saxophone; Les Nicholson, trumpet; Neville Minon, trombone; and Bob Hebden, rhythm. Roy, Neville and Peter Alloway were all still private music teachers at this time and some of their pupils were the first students to be part of this adventure.
					<br><br>
					The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was up and running, meeting once a month for rehearsals with an expectation that each section would practise individually or as a group in between these rehearsals.
					<br><br>
					Sadly Roy passed away on 1st January 1993 after a period of illness. Les continued to manage the band and conduct rehearsals, as well as playing first trumpet. In 1997 he enlisted the help of John Ruffle who took on the role of Musical Director, allowing Les to relax a little and enjoy his playing more. Roy would no doubt be very proud to see how much his beloved Big Band has developed since its formation as it is now a very accomplished band with a diverse repertoire and the technical expertise capable of backing great Jazz singers.
					<br><br>
					The band today demonstrates it has achieved the aims of both Roy and Les with experienced musicians arriving in town and feeling very proud to join such a powerful big band. A number of the original student members from 1991 are still in the band and have now joined the ranks of the experienced musicians and new students are still progressing from school bands to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band.</p>
