        <h2>1983</h2>
         <p>The Townsville Community Music Centre was established on May 24th. Over the next few weeks, a constitution was drafted and endorsed at another meeting on June 15th. On September 1983, Fred Thompson was made chairman of the centre, with Gordon Dean as his Deputy and Jan Eagleton as his Secretary</p>

        <h2>1984</h2>
        <p>The centre recruited Mira Henderson as their first staff member, taking up the Acting Director Position. She instigated a series of classes starting in 1984 using the skills of people living in Townsville to enhance and encourage music learners of all ages.</p>

        <h2>1985</h2>
        <p>Kirsty Veron was appointed as the first Director, and worked with Mira in the 1983 classes. She held this position until 1988 leading the new organisation into a strong position in the Townsville arts community.

        <h2>1985</h2>
        <p>Also in 1985, the Music Centre produced Benjamin Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral involving hundreds of children and some of Townsville's best-known musicians. This was by the no means the only major production mounted by the Music Centre but was probably the largest.

        <h2>1987</h2>
        <p>The centre had its first fund raising dinner this year, providing a wonderful mixture of food, wine, and music. The first few dinners were held at the home of Paul and June Tonnoir in North Ward. The dinner became an annual tradition which ran until 2004.</p>

        <h2>1988</h2>
        <p>In 1988, Mary Lou Schoenfeldt was appointed as Administrator. Although this was initially a small part time job with limited responsibilities, Mary Lou contributed tremendously to the Centre, and the cultural life of the City. Unfortunately, she retired in 2003 due to ill health.</p>

        <h2>1999</h2>
        <p>Arts Queensland, a major funder of Music Centre, agreed to provide funding on a three year basis. This made it easier for the Centre to plan and reduced the time spent on repetitive grant applications. This arrangement ran until 2004.</p>
