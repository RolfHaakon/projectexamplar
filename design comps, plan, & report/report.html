    <h1>CP1406 - Project Report</h1>
    <h2>Team RARZ</h2>
    <p><strong>Members:</strong> Ong Zhen Hui, Toh Tse-Chuan Renard, Rolf Haakon Rokseth, Arvin Kosasih</p>
    <a href="http://ditwebtsv.jcu.edu.au/~jc478635/a2/index.html">Site Home Page</a><br>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/RolfHaakon/projectexamplar" target="_blank">projectexamplar</a></p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The goal of the site is to increase volunteers through recruiting new members and engaging current members in their activities. It also aims to increase ticket sales, especially to the general public. Additionally, the site seeks to encourage performers to allow the client to advertise and hold concerts for them.</p>
    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
    <p>Brief details of who did what</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ong Zhen Hui: </strong>
        <br>
        Our website is built based on her design comps.
        <br>

    <h2>Testing Details</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Testing: </strong>
    <br>Zhen Hui and a friend(not part of the group) tested for any bugs and broken links. Ensured every page can link to every page, and that the javascripts are working.
    <br>
    <br>
    Renard also tested for broken links on his own. Renard's sister acted as a user looking to volunteer on the site, and managed to access it quite easily without any help. She was also tasked to find a single artist, Townsville Community Music Centre's address, past events. Managed to find all of it without much difficulty.
    <br><br>
    
    <br>
    any details required to test the site, including usernames, passwords, instructions if needed, outstanding issues (like things that look as though they work but don't)</p>

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong>
    <br>Everyone is really cooperative and responsible. Each member accept their assigned task without any complaints, and all of us try our best to keep to deadlines and finish the assigned task before the next meeting. This in turn allowed us enough time to cross check on each other's work, give feedback for improvements.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong>  NIL </p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong>
    <br>Before we started this assignment, none of us had any prior experience with Github, but we were all willing to learn it. We even tasked ourselves to learn how to use Github before starting the project itself, so that we can facilitate and keep up to date on the progress of everyone.</p>
